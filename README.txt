This is a development folder for a boredom experiment. We're hypothesizing that boredom results from an inability to meaningfully engage. We propose that environments that offer more opportunities to engage should reduce boredom. We suggest that highly uncertain environments offer more opportunities to engage, and should therefore be considered less boring.

For this experiment we're using Plinko to expose participants to environments with varying certainty. The current goal is to have participants play Plinko against a computer that shifts distributions frequently (high uncertainty - HU) or infrequently (low uncertainty - LU). We predict that HU environments will be considered less boring than LU environments.

The current folder is meant to serve as a development folder for the version of Plinko we're planning on using. It'll be a cup condition in which the position of the cup can be changed, but not the width. This will be our first version and we may consider changing it later on (e.g., give participants more ways to modify the cup).
